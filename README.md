# Human Detector and Counter Using YOLO
## Project Overview
This project implements a human detection and counting system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model. The application utilizes a webcam or a video feed to identify and count the number of humans present in the frame, providing real-time feedback. It is built using Python and OpenCV, with the deep learning model pre-trained on the COCO dataset.

## Features
- Real-time human detection using YOLO
- Display of detection results with bounding boxes around detected individuals
- Count of detected humans displayed in the console
- Integration with Matplotlib for displaying frames

## Requirements
 To run this project, you will need the following:
 - Python 3.x
 - OpenCV
 - NumPy
 - Matplotlib

#You can install the required Python packages using pip:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
